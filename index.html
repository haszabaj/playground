        <h4 class="text-center"> Here's a timeline of Aaron's very extraordinary life:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1986</strong>- born in Highland Park, Illinois, USA</li>
          <li><strong>2000</strong>- becomes a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification</li>
          <li><strong>2001</strong>- joines the RDFCore working group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),[70] where he authored RFC 3870, Application/RDF+XML Media Type Registration. The document described a new media type, "RDF/XML", designed to support the Semantic Web
          <li><strong>2005</strong>- drops Stanford Univeristy, pursues work on Infogami (flexible content management system to allow the creation of rich and visually interesting websites). Eventually Infogami merges with Reddit</li>
          <li><strong>2006</strong>- Aaron's company is acquired by Cond√© Nast Publications, the owner of Wired magazine. Swartz moves with his company to San Francisco to work on Wired, finds office life uncongenial, ultimately leaves the company</li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong>- Swartz starts Watchdog.net, "the good government site with teeth," to aggregate and visualize data about politicians. He writes a widely circulated Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</li>
            <li><strong>2008</strong>- Swartz downloads about 2.7 million federal court documents stored in the PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) database managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
The Huffington Post characterized his actions this way: "Swartz downloaded public court documents from the PACER system in an effort to make them available outside of the expensive service. The move drew the attention of the FBI, which ultimately decided not to press charges as the documents were, in fact, public."</li>
            <li><strong>2008</strong>- works with Virgil Griffith to design and implement Tor2web, an HTTP proxy for Tor-hidden services. The proxy was designed to provide easy access to Tor from a basic web browser</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong>- Helpes launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Swartz led the first activism event of his career with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, delivering thousands of "Honor Kennedy" petition signatures to Massachusetts legislators asking them to fulfill former Senator Ted Kennedy's last wish by appointing a senator to vote for health care reform
          <li><strong>2010</strong>- co-founds Demand Progress, a political advocacy group that organizes people online to "take action by contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word" about civil liberties, government reform, and other issues</li>
            <li><strong>2010-11</strong>- Swartz conducts research studies on political corruption as a Lab Fellow in Harvard University's Edmond J. Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption</li>
            <li><strong>2010-11</strong>- Swartz uses JSTOR, a digital repository, to download a large number of academic journal articles through MIT's computer network. At the time, Swartz was a research fellow at Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account. The authorities said Swartz downloaded the documents through a laptop connected to a networking switch in a controlled-access wiring closet at MIT. When discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film Swartz and Swartz's computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of Swartz, the download was stopped and Swartz identified</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong>- Swartz is arrested near the Harvard campus by MIT police and a U.S. Secret Service agent. He is arraigned in Cambridge District Court on two state charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. Later he is maliciously prosecuted, eventually his maximum criminal exposure is increased up to 50 years of imprisonment and $1 million in fines. The federal prosecution involved what was characterized by numerous critics such as former Nixon White House counsel John Dean as an "overcharging" 13-count indictment and "overzealous" prosecution for alleged computer crimes, brought by the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz</li>
            <li><strong>2011-12</strong>- Swartz and Kevin Poulsen design and implement DeadDrop, a system that allows anonymous informants to send electronic documents without fear of disclosure</li>
            <li><strong>2012</strong>- Swartz is the key player in the campain for preventing the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which sought to combat Internet copyright violations but was criticized on the basis that it would have made it easier for the U.S. government to shut down web sites accused of violating copyright and would have placed intolerable burdens on Internet providers</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong>- Swartz commits suicide. His family and his partner created a memorial website on which they issued a statement, saying: "He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized his friend and sometime client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, "The question this government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept."</li>
